# grpahql_with_go


Certainly! Below is a sample README file that you might use for a project integrating GraphQL with Go. This example assumes you're using the popular libraries such as `gorilla/mux` for routing and `graphql-go` for handling GraphQL. Adjust it as necessary based on your specific libraries and project setup.

# Go GraphQL Integration Example

This project demonstrates how to integrate GraphQL with a Go backend. It uses the `graphql-go` library to create a GraphQL server and `gorilla/mux` for routing. This example provides a simple API for managing a list of items with basic CRUD operations.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Git

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-graphql-example.git
cd go-graphql-example
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: The entry point of the application which sets up the server.
- `schema/`: Contains the GraphQL schema definitions.
- `resolver/`: Contains the resolver functions for the schema.
- `model/`: Defines the data models used in the application.
- `handler/`: Contains the HTTP handler that sets up the GraphQL endpoint.

## GraphQL Schema

The GraphQL schema is defined in `schema/schema.graphql`. It includes types for Query and Mutation.

### Queries

- `item(id: ID!): Item`: Retrieves an item by its ID.
- `listItems: [Item]`: Retrieves a list of all items.

### Mutations

- `createItem(name: String!): Item`: Creates a new item.
- `updateItem(id: ID!, name: String!): Item`: Updates an existing item.
- `deleteItem(id: ID!): Item`: Deletes an item.

## Example Queries

You can interact with the GraphQL server using any GraphQL client. Below are some example queries you can try:

### Query an Item

```graphql
{
  item(id: "1") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### List All Items

```graphql
{
  listItems {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### Create an Item

```graphql
mutation {
  createItem(name: "New Item") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Testing

For testing the GraphQL queries, you can use tools like GraphQL Playground, Postman, or simply use CURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "{ listItems { id name } }" }' http://localhost:8080/graphql
```
